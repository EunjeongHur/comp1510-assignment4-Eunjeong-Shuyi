## Any important comments you'd like to make about your work:
Welcome to play our game "A Cat's Story"!

In this game you will be able to experience the life of a cat, meet different people/cats and develop stories with them. There are 9 different endings you can experience based on your selections for in-game events.

All the characters in this game are designed to represent the important people in our life, such as parents, siblings, partner and best friend. We hope that we can bring you some happiness and hope through our stories! Please enjoy :)

When you play the game, please wait till the script finish before entering new inputs. 

This is because there is one known bug for this game: When scripts are still loading and new inputs are entered, it may select one option before it gets displayed. We tried to research and find out how to solve this issue, but we found out disabling input temporarily requires module msvcrt and getch. Because of this, unfortunately we were not able to solve this bug in this sprint.
